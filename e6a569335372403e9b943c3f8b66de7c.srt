- [Instructor] Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.007
In this video,

3
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.001
we're going to talk about some of the most common use cases

4
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.004
for AI within the analytics workflow.

5
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.000
There are tons of things you can do with this technology,

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.001
and these are just some

7
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.000
of the most powerful use cases that we've explored.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.007
You can use it to generate code or formulas.

9
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.002
You can use it to be a tutor

10
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.002
and explain some technical concepts with pointed questions.

11
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.009
You can use it for troubleshooting or debugging.

12
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.009
You can comment your code

13
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.002
if you have some that's particularly lengthy or confusing.

14
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.007
You can add comments there to make it more human readable.

15
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.001
You can optimize your queries or your formulas

16
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.005
for better performance.

17
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.004
You can generate step-by-step tutorials.

18
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.009
You can ask for data visualization tips

19
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.000
to help improve your data storytelling.

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And you can use it to automate tasks,

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.005
research some specific technical topics,

22
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.009
or even generate sample data.

23
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.008
This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

24
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.003
These are just some of the most common

25
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.000
and powerful use cases that we've explored.

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.005
We'll also show you videos where you can dive into Excel,

27
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.000
Google Sheets, Power BI, SQL, and Python,

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.007
and you can get some more specific walkthroughs

29
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.004
of each of these different use cases in action.

30
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.000
I hope you check those out.

31
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.007
And just remember that some of these use cases

32
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.009
are already firing on all cylinders for these AI tools.

33
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.003
Other ones, the results may vary.

34
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.000
We expect these to get much better over time,

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.005
so you want to learn how to do these things now

36
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.007
so that as the tools progress,

37
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.005
you'll be right there with the technology

38
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.003
so that you'll be able to use these tools

39
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.006
to maximize your effectiveness as an analyst.
