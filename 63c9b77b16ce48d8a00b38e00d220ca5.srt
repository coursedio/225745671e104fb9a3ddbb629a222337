00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] All right.

2
00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:04.000
So we just took a look at a ton of different ways

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.003
analysts can use ChatGPT and Google Bard

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:07.008
in their day-to-day work.

5
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:08.008
And some of the demos,

6
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.006
ChatGPT and Bard performed amazingly well

7
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.009
and gave us exactly what we needed.

8
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.004
In other cases, they fell flat or even lied to us.

9
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.004
But the point of these demos wasn't to show

10
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.006
how accurate or inaccurate these tools are,

11
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.008
but rather that tools like ChatGPT

12
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.006
will change the way data professionals work.

13
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.006
Even though these tools will never be perfect,

14
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.006
they're going to continue to get better.

15
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.006
So we expect there to be more cases

16
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.006
where they perform exceptionally well

17
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.005
and fewer where they fall flat.

18
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.009
And so analysts who are able to leverage these tools

19
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.008
will be able to stay competitive and excel in the age of AI.

20
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.003
Analysts who shun these tools or stay out of the game

21
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.005
will have a harder time keeping up with their colleagues

22
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.003
that are AI augmented.

23
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.002
And of course, as we saw, AI isn't perfect

24
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.009
and may hallucinate or provide incorrect responses.

25
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.001
Again, we expect this to get better over time

26
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.002
but you still always have to take these responses

27
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.008
with a grain of salt.

28
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.000
And remember that you are ultimately responsible

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.002
for verifying the accuracy of the model output.

30
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.005
Prompt engineering can dramatically improve

31
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.001
response quality.

32
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.005
If you want to get good results,

33
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.001
you need to provide good input.

34
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.001
So make sure to be specific, provide meaningful context,

35
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.003
and iterate to provide accurate and relevant responses.

36
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.000
And finally, as we saw, AI tools can be applied

37
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.006
to many types of analytics use cases.

38
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.008
Tools like ChatGPT can help troubleshoot or generate code,

39
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.007
automate tasks and much more.

40
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:33.007
And before we let you go,

41
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.001
let's take a brief look at the future.

42
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.000
In terms of revolutionizing the way analysts work,

43
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.001
ChatGPT and Bard are only the beginning.

44
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.008
In just the handful of months it's been

45
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.009
since ChatGPT was released,

46
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.008
we've already heard major announcements

47
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.001
from companies like Microsoft and Tableau

48
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.003
on integrating AI tools

49
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.006
into the software analysts use on a daily basis.

50
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.003
So these AI tools are going to be increasingly integrated

51
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.001
with our analytics work.

52
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.005
And just like the internet at the turn of the century,

53
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.006
AI tools will fundamentally change the future of work.

54
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.004
And so our advice for moving forward

55
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.005
is stay up-to-date with new tools and technology.

56
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.003
The AI industry is evolving quickly

57
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.000
so make sure to follow the latest news and developments

58
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.005
from trusted companies and thought leaders in this space.

59
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.007
Be curious but skeptical.

60
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.003
While we expect some amazing new AI developments

61
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.002
in the coming years,

62
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:27.000
we also expect to see some unrealistic promises

63
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.003
from companies trying to capitalize on the height.

64
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.004
Just as we've seen with every major tech trend

65
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.002
in the past few decades,

66
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.009
we do see some very concrete

67
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.004
and influential improvements in the space

68
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.000
but there's also a lot of people

69
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.008
trying to get in on the hype.

70
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.000
Staying open-minded is going to enable you

71
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.009
to take the best of what's to come,

72
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.001
but staying skeptical is going to help you avoid

73
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.004
some of the traps that these false promises present.

74
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.006
And finally, build a well-rounded skillset.

75
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.008
So at Maven Analytics, we've always preached this

76
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.001
but this has never been more important.

77
00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:59.002
As tools like ChatGPT

78
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:02.006
begin to automate more complex technical tasks,

79
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.001
focus on developing your uniquely human skills

80
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.002
like problem solving, strategic thinking,

81
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.007
communication, and business acumen.

82
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.000
If you're able to continue to grow in these areas,

83
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.004
then AI is only going to make you better at your job.

84
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:16.004
AI will not only help you work

85
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.005
through the technical aspect of your job more quickly,

86
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.001
it will also free up a lot of time

87
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:24.000
for you to focus on the big picture.

88
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.009
So that's going to conclude this course.

89
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:26.007
We at the Maven team

90
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.003

91
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:30.007
and we're looking forward to seeing

92
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.006
how you implement these tools in your day-to-Day work.

93
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:35.007
