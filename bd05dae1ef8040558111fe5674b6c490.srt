00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.009
- [Host] Before we dive into specific AI tools like ChatGPT

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.005
and Google Bard, it's worth taking a step back

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.007
and understanding the broader AI landscape.

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.009
Artificial intelligence is a very broad term that relates

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.007
to machines and computer systems

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.008
that mimic functions associated with human intelligence,

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.001
like decision-making, image recognition,

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.002
self-driving cars, and more.

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.003
Within the field of artificial intelligence

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.008
lies machine learning.

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.004
These are going to be the models that act as the brains

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.007
of artificial intelligence systems.

13
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.008
They help computers learn with minimal human instruction

14
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:37.002
and get more accurate when exposed to more data.

15
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.002
In that more data piece is critical in explaining why

16
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.000
we've seen an explosion in AI

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.009
and machine learning in the past few decades.

18
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.000
With the proliferation of the internet,

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.004
mobile devices, internet of things,

20
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.009
we're now generating more data than we ever have,

21
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.008
and that's enabled machine learning

22
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.006
to become more accurate than it ever could have been prior

23
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.003
to some of these inventions.

24
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.006
And within machine learning lies deep learning.

25
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.000
This is a very complex family of algorithms that's designed

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.004
to mimic the human brain

27
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.001
and learn almost exclusively without human intervention.

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.003
Large language models like ChatGPT and Google Bard

29
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.001
fall within this category.

30
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.001
And speaking of the human brain, there's still one area

31
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.000
where these models are not able to approach

32
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.006
what humans are able to do.

33
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.004
And that brings up the conversation

34
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.008
between weak versus strong AI.

35
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.001
Currently, we're in this state of weak AI, which is defined

36
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.007
as AI that can only perform specific tasks.

37
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.003
So for example, ChatGPT could tell you how

38
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.001
to drive a car if you asked it,

39
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.007
but if you asked it to drive your car

40
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.006
for you, it couldn't do that,

41
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:42.007
even though it surfaced all of this knowledge

42
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.004
that you'd need to drive a car.

43
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.003
Strong AI or artificial general intelligence would be able

44
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.006
to do that at some point in the future.

45
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.002
This is often what's depicted in science fiction

46
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.001
and often what is very scary to many folks about this field,

47
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.002
these systems would be able to learn

48
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.007
and perform any task that a human could do.

49
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.008
So if you could ask ChatGPT,

50
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.002
can you go buy me groceries today?

51
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:09.001
And it was able to solve all of the problems that it needed

52
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.009
to without your intervention, that would be much closer

53
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.008
to strong AI than we are today.

54
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.008
As of now, we haven't seen any strong AI systems

55
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.002
implemented, but this is likely on the horizon

56
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.006
and possibly within our lifetimes.

57
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.002
And just in case you were wondering, both machine learning

58
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.009
and deep learning have their roots and statistics.

59
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.007
A lot of the algorithms rely on statistical concepts,

60
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:32.001
but there's one major philosophical

61
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.001
difference between these fields.

62
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.006
Statistics is very much concerned with being able

63
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.008
to confidently say, yes, there is a relationship

64
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:44.003
between variable A and B, and that relationship is X.

65
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.008
Machine learning and deep learning don't care

66
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.000
about those relationships.

67
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.009
They just care about the accuracy of output.

68
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.002
And because they don't care about these relationships

69
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.006
and they certainly don't care about humans understanding

70
00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:00.001
these relationships, they're able to be much more complex

71
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:01.009
than the same statistical algorithms

72
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.003
that they might be based off of.

73
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.007
This has led them to be called black box models

74
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:08.008
because we know what goes in and we know what comes out,

75
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:12.001
but we have no idea what goes on inside these algorithms.

76
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.009
They're often picking up millions or billions of nuances

77
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.003
and data that we really can't understand or detect.

78
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.002
But now let's take a look at generative AI specifically.
