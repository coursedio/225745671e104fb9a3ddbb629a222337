00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] Let's begin by setting some expectations.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
First off, this course is designed to be an overview

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.002
of how data professionals can use AI tools.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.006
We'll introduce the broader AI landscape

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.004
and tools like ChatGPT

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.008
and we'll review practical use cases for data analysts,

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.004
but we won't be diving deeply

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.005
into how these large language models actually work

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.009
or give an exhaustive list of everything

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.005
that they're capable of.

11
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.001
Next, we'll be using the free versions of these AI tools

12
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.006
for the course demos.

13
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.008
We'll quickly touch on some paid options

14
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.003
and alternative tools,

15
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.002
but the majority of what you see

16
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.001
will be shown using the free versions

17
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.004
of either ChatGPT or Google Bard.

18
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:45.009
Perhaps most importantly, AI is a rapidly evolving field

19
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.002
and these tools will change very, very quickly.

20
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.003
This technology is moving fast

21
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:54.003
and that means that existing products are going to change,

22
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.005
new vendors and tools will emerge,

23
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.002
but hopefully, the core concepts

24
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.007
and best practices you learn in this course

25
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.007
will remain relevant.

26
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.006
Last but not least, this course is designed

27
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.007
to be modular to fit your needs.

28
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.008
The first half of the course is designed for everyone.

29
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.009
It's where we'll talk about the AI landscape.

30
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.000
We'll introduce these different tools,

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.003
talk about prompt engineering, best practices, and so on.

32
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.009
But the second half is structured

33
00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.001
so that you can focus specifically

34
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.008
on the tools you use most as an analyst,

35
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:28.001
Excel, Sheets, SQL, Power BI, or Python.

36
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.009
Now of course, remember that what you see

37
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.005
on our screens during the demos

38
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.001
won't always match what you're seeing on yours,

39
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.003
especially given how these AI tools actually work,

40
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.001
but our goal is to give you some ideas and techniques

41
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.000
that you can take and apply to your own work.

42
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.002
So with that, we've got a lot to cover.

43
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.002
Let's get started.
