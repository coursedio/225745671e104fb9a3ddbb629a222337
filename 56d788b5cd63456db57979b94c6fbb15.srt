00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] All right, so for our next demo,

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.002
I'd like to explore how we might be able to use tools

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.008
like ChatGPT for data visualization.

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.008
Now, even though ChatGPT can't currently produce

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:15.001
visual responses outside of code samples, at least not yet,

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.003
I'm curious if we can use it

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.007
to better understand data viz best practices,

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.009
or have it recommend effective visuals

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.000
based on some given context.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.009
So let's go ahead and drop in a few prompts,

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.002
and kind of grade or score the responses we get back.

12
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.005
So first prompt, I'm analyzing a sample of wine data

13
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.003
and would like to understand the distribution

14
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.000
of wines by price point.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.003
What will be the best way to visualize this in Excel?

16
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:41.006
Now I'm being very deliberate

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.005
about how I've written this prompt, specifically the use

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.009
of this term distribution, right?

19
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:51.000
Because anyone who has expertise in data visualization

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.006
should recognize that histograms are widely known

21
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.001
as the clearest and most effective way

22
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.006
to visualize the distribution of values.

23
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.000
So that's what I'm looking for,

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that's kind of what I'm hoping to get back

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in ChatGPT's response, let's see what it looks like.

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.005
All right, so to visualize the distribution of wines

27
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.000
by price point, perfect.

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You can use a histogram or a column chart, which is fair.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.007
And then, even though we didn't ask for it,

30
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.005
it's giving us a nice kind of step-by-step guide

31
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.004
for how to actually produce those visuals.

32
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.005
And this is kind of nice, it's giving us a little summary

33
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.008
and description of when you might lean towards

34
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.006
a histogram versus a column chart, right?

35
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.005
Histogram for continuous data,

36
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.008
column chart for discreet or categorical.

37
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.004
I think that's a helpful, nice touch.

38
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.000
So overall, good start. Good response.

39
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.001
Let's try another prompt here.

40
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.005
This time, I'm analyzing data from my website,

41
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.005
and I'd like to show how total page views

42
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.001
and conversion rates have trended over time.

43
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.001
What would be the best way to visualize this in Excel?

44
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.007
Again, I'm being very deliberate

45
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.008
and specific about this prompt.

46
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.008
This time, I'm asking how to visualize two metrics

47
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.000
that are on totally different scales, right?

48
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We have total page views, which is a volume metric,

49
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.001
we've got conversion rate, which is a percentage

50
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.006
or a rate metric, and I'm asking about trending over time.

51
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.008
So in this case, I'm looking for at least some element

52
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.007
of a line chart or column chart to show trending,

53
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.004
and if I were approaching this as a human being,

54
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:20.002
I would likely use a combo chart, like a line and column

55
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:22.009
with a secondary axis so that I could show both

56
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.000
of these trends in one visual.

57
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.002
So let's see what ChatGPT comes back with here.

58
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.007
All right, so to visualize that trend,

59
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.004
you can use a line chart.

60
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.002
Okay, here's how you can do it.

61
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:39.000
Prepare the data, select the data, insert the chart,

62
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
customize it, finalize it,

63
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.006
make sure you're using date values, that's a nice touch.

64
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:48.002
So I'd give this response maybe a B or a C, right?

65
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.008
It got the line chart to show the trending,

66
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.005
but it really didn't recognize the fact

67
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.006
that those two metrics we want to show

68
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.005
will likely be on very, very different scales.

69
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.002
So overall, not bad, not great.

70
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.009
Let's try one more example here.

71
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.006
All right, now I'm analyzing a dataset containing records

72
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:08.006
of auto accidents, and I'd like to visualize the data

73
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:12.006
in Excel to show when accidents are most likely to occur

74
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.005
by hour of day and by day of week.

75
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:18.007
Can you please suggest the best type of visual to use?

76
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.007
So while there are many different ways

77
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.009
you could potentially visualize the data

78
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.007
as it's described here, what I'm hoping to see

79
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:28.004
is something like a heat map returned,

80
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:31.001
which in this case, would be a really effective way

81
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.002
to show those accident counts across

82
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:36.004
those different dimensions, hour of day and day of week.

83
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:41.003
So let's see what ChatGPT comes up with for this one.

84
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.002
All right, to visualize when accidents

85
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:45.009
are most likely to occur, perfect.

86
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.000
It mentions heat map, so a combination of heat map

87
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.006
and clustered column, that's kind of interesting.

88
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:53.002
Personally, I think the heat map alone

89
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:56.005
can do the trick quite well.

90
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.002
And it says by combining a heat map

91
00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.007
and a clustered column,

92
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:01.006
you can effectively visualize the patterns

93
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.005
of auto accidents based on the hour of day

94
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:04.009
and the day of the week.

95
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.009
The heat map provides an overview of accident intensity,

96
00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.005
while a clustered column helps analyze the distribution

97
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:13.001
of accidents within each hour of the day.

98
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.008
Pretty good, I like that it landed on heat map,

99
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:18.000
especially just based on a relatively quick

100
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.006
and simple prompt.

101
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:22.000
So overall, you know, my take on this use case

102
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.009
is good, not great.

103
00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.008
Generally I think ChatGPT was able

104
00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:29.002
to make some smart recommendations here.

105
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.007
Histograms for distribution, line charts for trending,

106
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:35.003
and heat maps for accident frequencies,

107
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:38.002
and while it does kind of start to provide some reasoning

108
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:41.000
into why it's chosen certain visuals,

109
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.008
my recommendation here would be to really continue

110
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:47.004
to focus on learning data visualization best practices

111
00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:49.007
and design theory from the experts

112
00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:52.006
rather than expecting ChatGPT to play that role.
