00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] All right, let's kick off this section

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.008
by talking about how we can use AI

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.006
as our personal Excel tutor.

4
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.009
Now we're going to be focusing

5
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.002
on two different themes of prompts here in this demo.

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:14.003
First is using ChatGPT to better understand general topics

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.006
or concepts related to Excel.

8
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.003
And then we're going to dive deeper

9
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.005
into a very common and powerful use case, which is

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.006
better understanding specific formulas or functions.

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.007
So starting with general topics or concepts, let's kick it

12
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.004
off with something pretty easy and straightforward.

13
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.007
Can you please share a list

14
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.005
of some of the most common Excel shortcuts?

15
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:38.007
This should be an absolute layup for ChatGPT.

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.001
This is really common information.

17
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.003
There's a lot of public documentation for it to draw from.

18
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:45.002
And as you can see

19
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.007
we get a pretty clear response pretty much instantaneously.

20
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.002
Here's some of the most common Excel shortcuts

21
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.006
that can help you navigate

22
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.009
and work more efficiently in Excel.

23
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.000
So that's great, but you might be wondering, you know

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.006
why wouldn't I just google that information?

25
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.000
Which is a fair point

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.005
and this is where that conversational nature

27
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.006
of ChatGPT really sets it apart.

28
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.003
So now that ChatGPT understands the context

29
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.007
of our initial question or prompt,

30
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.002
we can follow up with something like this.

31
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.003
Can you narrow down this list to shortcuts

32
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.005
most commonly used by data analysts, for instance.

33
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.002
So it's going to say certainly here are some Excel

34
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.005
shortcuts that are commonly used by data analysts.

35
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:26.009
We're going to get a lot

36
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.001
of the same ones here, copy, paste, undo and save

37
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.009
and it looks like we're getting a few new ones here

38
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.003
towards the end that may be a little bit more

39
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.005
relevant for analytics, right?

40
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.002
We've got the alt shift and control shift shortcuts here.

41
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.008
We've got auto sum, the F9 calculation and so on.

42
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:46.004
But we can take it a level deeper, right?

43
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.002
And we can follow up again and say, "Okay, now

44
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:53.002
can you include both the PC and MAC versions as a table?"

45
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.004
And this is no problem for ChatGPT.

46
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:58.002
I love the format that it comes back with.

47
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.008
Super helpful little cheat sheet breaking down each action

48
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.009
or shortcut based on the PC and Mac syntax.

49
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.008
So this is information that you certainly could get

50
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.001
from a tool like Google, but the fact that ChatGPT can kind

51
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.003
of consolidate all this information in one place

52
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.002
without you having to scrub through different

53
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.003
search results, look at different forms or articles

54
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:22.001
or videos that makes it really, really intuitive

55
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.000
and really convenient as a research tool.

56
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.007
And then one more quick example with kind

57
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:30.002
of this generic topic or concept approach,

58
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.007
you might type something like this.

59
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.005
Can you please summarize each type of formula error in Excel

60
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:35.008
and how to fix them?

61
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm actually going to drop this into a new chat

62
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.001
because technically this is kind of new unrelated prompts

63
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.000
and this shouldn't be a problem for ChatGPT, either.

64
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.007
It's going to give us these common errors

65
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:48.007
DIV/0 value ref.

66
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:51.000
And what I love is that it offers

67
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.006
potential solutions as well.

68
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.005
You can use functions like is number or

69
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.006
if error to solve value errors and so on and so forth.

70
00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.007
So as an Excel beginner or intermediate,

71
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.009
having this information

72
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.003
at your fingertips is really, really helpful.

73
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.005
So next up, let's talk about specific functions, right?

74
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.003
This is a super common

75
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:12.004
really powerful use case that I tend to use ChatGPT

76
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.008
for quite a bit.

77
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.009
And let's start a new prompt here.

78
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.008
If you've been around Excel for the past year or two

79
00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:20.005
you've probably heard of the X lookup function.

80
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.001
So let's start with something like this.

81
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.006
Can you please explain how the X lookup function works

82
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.000
in Excel?

83
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.004
And we'll see what we get back here.

84
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:30.007
So it's a powerful lookup and reference function.

85
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:35.006
It was introduced in Excel 365, Excel 2021 for Windows.

86
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.007
Here's kind of a quick summary.

87
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:42.000
I love that it drops in this kind of CSS code box here

88
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.001
where we can click to copy that code

89
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:47.000
straight out of the ChatGPT response.

90
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.002
And what it does, it starts breaking

91
00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:52.001
down the arguments or parameters and what they do.

92
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.000
It lays out key features and benefits

93
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.006
which is a nice touch.

94
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:57.008
And then I really like how it kind

95
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:01.003
of recaps or summarizes the formula at the end, right?

96
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.000
It provides enhanced functionality for performing look-ups.

97
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.008
It makes it easier to retrieve data based

98
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:07.006
on specific criteria.

99
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.001
But if I'm brand new to Excel

100
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.004
or I'm still kind of in the beginner phases

101
00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:14.002
this still might be a bit over complicated, right?

102
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.006
It kind of sounds

103
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:17.008
like I'm reading official Microsoft documentation here.

104
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:20.007
So let's do a little bit of prompt engineering here

105
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:22.007
and add some follow-ups to really hone in

106
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:25.003
on the type of response we're looking for.

107
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.009
So this is a tip that I love to use all the time.

108
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.003
I'm going to say now can you explain it

109
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.002
as if you were describing it to a child?

110
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:35.006
And note that I'm saying it here, I don't have to explain

111
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:38.006
that I'm looking for the X lookup syntax again

112
00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:41.004
because ChatGPT already has that context.

113
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:44.008
And by giving it this kind of role-playing exercise,

114
00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:48.005
I can hone in on the specific level of complexity

115
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:49.008
that I'm looking for.

116
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:52.008
So it says, let's explain X lookup in a simpler way

117
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.002
for a child to understand.

118
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.003
Imagine you have a big list of names, you want to find the age

119
00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:59.007
of a specific person without having to look

120
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.002
through the entire list.

121
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:02.006
That's where X lookup comes in.

122
00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:05.000
So you can see the, the words, the terminology

123
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.005
even the tone is really geared towards a younger audience

124
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:11.008
as opposed to an Excel expert or analyst.

125
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:14.005
So it's still accurate if you read through it

126
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.005
but it's just a bit more playful than my previous response.

127
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:20.009
And now one more tip here that I absolutely love is

128
00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.004
using a prompt like this where it can say,

129
00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:27.002
"Can you provide an example using some sample data

130
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.002
and show the formula syntax?"

131
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:32.001
And this is awesome because ChatGPT is actually

132
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:35.000
going to generate some sample data on the spot.

133
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.007
In this case, it came up with a table with names in column A

134
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:40.007
and ages in column B.

135
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:43.007
Very ubiquitous, common and easy to understand.

136
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:46.006
Example, it gives me an example syntax with an X

137
00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:49.007
lookup function here, breaks down that formula argument

138
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:53.000
by argument and then again summarizes it here at the bottom.

139
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.007
And it's even adding kind of some

140
00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:56.007
of the optional arguments here as well

141
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:59.009
to show some variations of the basic syntax.

142
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.002
So I'd give it a 10 out of 10 for this response.

143
00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:05.008
It's accurate, it's intuitive, and it's really

144
00:06:05.008 --> 00:06:08.007
easy to digest even for a beginner Excel user.

145
00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:11.004
Now, last quick example that I want to share here

146
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.005
is using ChatGPT to explain what a specific

147
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:17.004
Excel formula is actually doing.

148
00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:18.002
So in this case

149
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.000
suppose we have an Excel worksheet that looks like this.

150
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Here we're looking at job salaries for different industries,

151
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.008
job titles and cities.

152
00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:27.007
We've got the average salary in column D

153
00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:29.009
year over year growth in column E.

154
00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.002
And what we're doing here is producing a subset

155
00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:35.007
of that data to show just the top 10 highest paying jobs.

156
00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:39.003
And to do that, we're using a formula that looks like this.

157
00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:42.008
This is a combination of nested dynamic array functions.

158
00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:45.007
It's a little bit long, a little bit complicated,

159
00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:48.001
especially if you're not an Excel expert.

160
00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:49.009
Now suppose you've inherited this worksheet

161
00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.004
and you're trying to reverse engineer what's going on here.

162
00:06:52.004 --> 00:06:54.000
While in a case like that,

163
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.009
you could simply copy the formula straight out of Excel

164
00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.007
jump back to ChatGPT

165
00:06:58.007 --> 00:07:03.000
and add a new prompt that looks something like this.

166
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.008
Can you explain this Excel formula in simple terms?

167
00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:13.007
I'm going to paste it right here and send it to ChatGPT.

168
00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:18.000
And right off the bat, instantaneously it starts breaking

169
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.006
down what this function's doing.

170
00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:22.005
It's amazing how powerful and fast this tool really is.

171
00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:25.000
So it's going to start with the filter function

172
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.007
explain what that's doing.

173
00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:30.000
It's filtering that range, but only where values

174
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.003
in column D are greater

175
00:07:31.003 --> 00:07:33.008
than or equal to the 10th largest value.

176
00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:35.001
That's correct.

177
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:37.007
Then we talk about how the sort function's working.

178
00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:39.006
We lay out the different arguments

179
00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:41.001
within that sort function.

180
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:43.007
And then I love this quick recap or summary at the end.

181
00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:46.005
So in simple terms, this formula filters the data

182
00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:48.005
in the range based on the condition

183
00:07:48.005 --> 00:07:50.005
that the values in column D should be greater

184
00:07:50.005 --> 00:07:52.006
than or equal to the 10th largest value.

185
00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:54.004
Then it sorts that filtered data

186
00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:57.001
in descending order based on column D.

187
00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:59.001
Great response, perfectly clear

188
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.000
and perfectly accurate as well.

189
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.003
So to wrap up this demo,

190
00:08:02.003 --> 00:08:04.000
let's talk through a couple of tips here.

191
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.006
Again, these types of use cases are best when

192
00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:09.005
you're asking questions that have clear definitions

193
00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:12.003
and a lot of public documentation to draw from.

194
00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:14.005
And it's really important to be smart

195
00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:16.004
about your prompt engineering.

196
00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:19.000
So we talked about things like asking for visuals

197
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.006
asking for sample data, for syntax

198
00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:23.008
for common use cases, and so on.

199
00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:25.008
That's going to be really helpful to get the results

200
00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:26.007
that you want.

201
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:29.001
And then again, I love role-playing a little bit

202
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:32.003
with the prompts to help modify and tune the level

203
00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:34.005
of complexity that you're looking for.

204
00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:37.001
Do you want the language to be appropriate

205
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.001
for a 10 year old or for a rocket scientist?

206
00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:42.004
Now, overall, I love this application for ChatGPT,

207
00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:44.007
I give it very, very high marks

208
00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:47.002
for accuracy for these types of use cases.

209
00:08:47.002 --> 00:08:49.004
And it's really just a great way to fill knowledge gaps

210
00:08:49.004 --> 00:08:53.000
and learn about new Excel topics really quickly

211
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.002
and really effectively.
