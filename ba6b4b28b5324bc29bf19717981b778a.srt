00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.001
- [Presenter] Hey there.

2
00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.005
In this video, we're going to be talking about why every person

3
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.006
who's building a data career needs to be learning AI tools.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.005
The world is changing fast.

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.003
AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard,

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.002
and others are just allowing people to do things

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.009
that were really complicated and took lots of time

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.006
in now, a matter of minutes, sometimes even seconds.

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.007
This technology is a total game changer.

10
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.003
And right now, it's only in its infancy

11
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.000
so some things it's really good at,

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.007
some things it's kind of just okay at,

13
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.002
some things it's having trouble with,

14
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.009
but it's going to keep getting better and better.

15
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.005
So here are just some of the reasons that every data pro

16
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.002
should be learning to use AI tools.

17
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.007
First, you want to improve your performance and efficiency,

18
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.004
leverage these tools to do things faster.

19
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.003
You can automate routine, low-value tasks

20
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:50.008
so that you can spend more time

21
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.007
on the higher value add activities

22
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.002
that you can bring to the table.

23
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.008
You can use AI as an easy way to check your work.

24
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.001
It can be a code buddy.

25
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.005
It can help think through your analysis.

26
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.008
You can leverage it for your learning

27
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.003
and answering quick-pointed questions.

28
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.001
And learning about these tools will help you stay

29
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.003
on the cutting edge and keep you competitive in your field.

30
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.005
So let's talk about whether your job

31
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.003
as a data analyst is at risk.

32
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:14.008
This is something a lot of people

33
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.005
are very concerned about right now with AI.

34
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.005
AI is not going to replace you.

35
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.004
Don't worry.

36
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.003
The fears about this happening are totally overblown.

37
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.009
Companies are always going to need human talent.

38
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.009
They're always going to need that intuition.

39
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.007
The thing to understand is that the skills required

40
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.003
to be an effective analyst are going to shift.

41
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:37.004
We call these three core skills the analytics trifecta:

42
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.001
strategic thinking, technical proficiency,

43
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.006
and communication skills.

44
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.007
This is what separates a good analyst

45
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.006
from one that's truly great,

46
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.000
a real 10X analyst that can help take an organization

47
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.002
to the next level.

48
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.001
Technical proficiency right here,

49
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.008
this is where AI really adds a lot of value.

50
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.007
It's a tool that will help things happen more efficiently.

51
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.009
It can fill technical skills gaps.

52
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.006
So it's definitely going to help here,

53
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.001
especially over time as the tools get better,

54
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.002
but it's really going to struggle

55
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.000
with strategic thinking and communication skills.

56
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.008
So since AI can help with the technical gaps,

57
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:16.001
analysts who have this amazing strategic thinking ability

58
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.001
and who are great with communicating

59
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.005
with their organization,

60
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.007
effectively telling a story with data,

61
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.002
and advocating for change

62
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:24.009
that's really going to impact the business

63
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.005
based on the data they're finding,

64
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:29.005
that's going to be the special sauce that you can use

65
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:34.001
and pair it with technical proficiency aided by AI tools

66
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.006
to be an amazing analyst that every company is going to value.

67
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.004
You need to learn these tools to stay competitive.

68
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:45.009
While an AI is not going to take your job, someone else might.

69
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.006
That could be someone else who's learning AI

70
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:49.000
and staying on the cutting edge

71
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.007
of these technical developments.

72
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.005
So you need to make sure that you're doing it yourself.

73
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.005
Imagine being a data analyst today

74
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:57.005
who had never learned spreadsheets

75
00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.002
or how to use the internet.

76
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:02.001
We're likely going to be saying the same thing about ChatGPT

77
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.000
and other AI tools in the near future.

78
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.004
The time to learn this stuff is now.

79
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.007
And this is just the next flavor

80
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.009
of the same theme we've seen forever.

81
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:14.000
The key to building a long-term successful career in data

82
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.009
is the same as it's ever been:

83
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.003
building a strong foundational skillset,

84
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.003
getting great at strategic thinking,

85
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.001
getting great with communicating

86
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.001
and advocating for change

87
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.004
that will help drive an organization forward,

88
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:28.003
and then keeping your skills sharp

89
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.008
and embracing and adapting

90
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.005
to the change that's coming about.

91
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.006
This is just the most recent tool.

92
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:35.000
There have been others before it

93
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.006
like Tableau and Power BI coming in

94
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.001
and becoming a very valuable skillset for the data world.

95
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.001
There will be other tools in the future.

96
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.003
As long as you have that strong foundation,

97
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:49.005
can think critically about a business, problem solve,

98
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:51.000
communicate with others,

99
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.008
and you keep learning the technical skills as they come up,

100
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:55.004
you're going to have a great career

101
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.001
and you'll be talent that every business will value.
