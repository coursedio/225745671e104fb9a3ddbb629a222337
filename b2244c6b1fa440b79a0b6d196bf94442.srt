- [Instructor] Hey everybody.

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.007
In this video we've got another tip for prompt engineering

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.008
to get better results from AI tools

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.005
like ChatGPT and Google Bard.

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.007
And that tip is to provide as much context

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.004
as the AI tool needs to get you the exact result

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.001
that you need to solve your problem.

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.006
Let's go through a quick example.

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.001
So we've got this first original prompt saying,

10
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.000
"What are common supply chain KPIs?"

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.004
And that works, but look at what comes back

12
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.005
when we give a lot more context saying,

13
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.005
"I'm a data analyst working on supply chain analytics

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.007
for a multinational distribution company.

15
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.007
What KPIs should I be analyzing for each metric

16
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.005
please include a formula showing how it's calculated."

17
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.000
And then we even give an example

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.007
of what we'd like to see.

19
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.004
Here as an analyst who's trying

20
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.006
to get up to speed on a new industry,

21
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.002
this output that you get in the result is just fantastic.

22
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.004
It's exactly what you would want to see as a first pass

23
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.000
and then you could drill deeper

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.002
into each one of them after

25
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.009
to help yourself get up to speed.

26
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.005
So remember, when you're using these AI tools,

27
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.001
give them all the context.

28
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.009
It can really help the AI produce a result

29
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.002
that's going to be exactly what you need.
