- [Presenter] Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.003
In this video, we're going to go through our first tip

3
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.009
for prompt engineering to get better results

4
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.003
from your AI tools.

5
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.009
And that tip is to be clear and specific.

6
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.004
The more specific you are

7
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.000
when you're prompting these AI tools,

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.006
the better the result is going to be.

9
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.001
So, let's go through an example.

10
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.002
Here, we've got a question, we're working in Excel

11
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.004
and we want to know how to calculate year over year growth.

12
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.000
The response that we get back is good,

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.006
but it could be even better

14
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.006
if we told the AI tool exactly what we are trying to do.

15
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.008
So here's what a better prompt would look like.

16
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.004
You see now we're including the fact

17
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.009
that we want an Excel formula

18
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.009
and we're also telling the AI tool where the data lives

19
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:44.000
in cells C two through C 100 and cells B two through B 100.

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.008
And you see the response here.

21
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.002
It's so much more clear.

22
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.000
It gives us the actual Excel formula, which is great.

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.004
And then, it also gives a little explanation of it below.

24
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.002
So keep that in mind.

25
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.008
Try to be as clear and specific

26
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.002
as you possibly can when you're writing these prompts.

27
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.006
And the pro-tip here is

28
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.007
if you're generating code, include details

29
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.000
like your variable names, your data types, your cell ranges,

30
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.004
whatever you can do to be as specific as possible.

31
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.009
It will really help out your response.
