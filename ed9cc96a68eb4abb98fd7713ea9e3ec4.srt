00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Before we dive into specific AI tools

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.005
like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it's worth taking a step back

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.004
and understanding the broader AI landscape.

4
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.004
Artificial intelligence is a very broad term

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.007
that relates to machines and computer systems

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.008
that mimic functions associated with human intelligence

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.008
like decision-making, image recognition,

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.002
self-driving cars, and more.

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.000
Within the field of artificial intelligence

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.008
lies machine learning.

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.004
These are going to be the models that act as the brains

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.008
of artificial intelligence systems.

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.005
They help computers learn with minimal human instruction

14
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.008
and get more accurate when exposed to more data.

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.009
And that more data piece is critical in explaining

16
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.008
why we've seen an explosion in AI and machine learning

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.005
in the past few decades.

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.000
With the proliferation of the internet,

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.001
mobile devices, internet of things,

20
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.009
we're now generating more data than we ever have

21
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.008
and that's enabled machine learning

22
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.001
to become more accurate than it ever could have been

23
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.002
prior to some of these inventions.

24
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.007
And within machine learning lies deep learning.

25
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.003
This is a very complex family of algorithms

26
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:05.004
that's designed to mimic the human brain

27
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.001
and learn almost exclusively without human intervention.

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.004
Large language models like ChatGPT

29
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.001
and Google Bard fall within this category.

30
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.007
And speaking of the human brain, there's still one area

31
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.000
where these models are not able to approach

32
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.006
what humans are able to do

33
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.004
and that brings up the conversation

34
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.008
between weak versus strong AI.

35
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.002
Currently, we're in this state of weak AI,

36
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:32.007
which is defined as AI that can only perform specific tasks.

37
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.001
So for example, ChatGPT could tell you

38
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.001
how to drive a car if you asked it,

39
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.002
but if you asked it to drive your car for you,

40
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.007
it couldn't do that even though it surfaced

41
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.004
all of this knowledge that you'd need to drive a car.

42
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.005
Strong AI, or artificial general intelligence,

43
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.006
would be able to do that at some point in the future.

44
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.002
This is often what's depicted in science fiction

45
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.001
and often what is very scary to many folks about this field.

46
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.002
These systems would be able to learn

47
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.007
and perform any task that a human could do.

48
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.007
So if you could ask ChatGPT,

49
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.008
"Can you go buy me groceries today?"

50
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.001
And it was able to solve all of the problems that it needed

51
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.009
to without your intervention, that would be much closer

52
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.008
to strong AI than we are today.

53
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.008
As of now, we haven't seen any strong AI systems

54
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.003
implemented, but this is likely on the horizon

55
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.006
and possibly within our lifetimes.

56
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.002
And just in case you were wondering, both machine learning

57
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.008
and deep learning have their roots in statistics.

58
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.008
A lot of the algorithms rely on statistical concepts,

59
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.001
but there's one major philosophical

60
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.008
difference between these fields.

61
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.006
Statistics is very much concerned with being able

62
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.009
to confidently say, yes, there is a relationship

63
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:44.002
between variable A and B and that relationship is X.

64
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.002
Machine learning and deep learning

65
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.000
don't care about those relationships,

66
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.009
they just care about the accuracy of output.

67
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.007
And because they don't care about these relationships

68
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.002
and they certainly don't care about humans understanding

69
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.008
these relationships, they're able to be much more complex

70
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:01.009
than the same statistical algorithms

71
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.003
that they might be based off of.

72
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.005
This has led them to be called black box models

73
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:08.008
because we know what goes in and we know what comes out,

74
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:12.001
but we have no idea what goes on inside these algorithms.

75
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.005
They're often picking up millions or billions of nuances

76
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:18.003
and data that we really can't understand or detect.

77
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.002
But now let's take a look at generative AI specifically.
