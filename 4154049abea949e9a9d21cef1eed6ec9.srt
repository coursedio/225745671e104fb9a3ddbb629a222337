00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] All right, so for our next demo,

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.009
what we're going to practice doing is actually pasting data

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.002
directly into ChatGPT and seeing if it can use

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.008
that sample data to help produce Excel formulas.

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.009
So this will be a little bit of a shortcut,

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.003
so that we don't have to necessarily describe

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.009
our data set perfectly in words.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.003
So in this case, we're working with

9
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.005
a small sample of customer records.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.001
We've got about 25 customers listed here.

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.003
First names, last names, city, state,

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.005
date of birth, and email address.

13
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.009
And what we're going to do is just copy and paste

14
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.009
this entire sample into ChatGPT.

15
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.002
We're going to ask it to write a formula for us,

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.000
and then we're going to take it a step further

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.001
and see if it can actually interpret

18
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.002
and analyze the data that we've provided it.

19
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.005
Now you can just simply copy and paste

20
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.001
the data straight from Excel,

21
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:52.001
but I found better results saving the data as a CSV,

22
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.002
opening it in a tool like Notepad,

23
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.004
and pasting the data from there.

24
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.009
So here's the data opened up in Notepad,

25
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:01.000
you can see the comma separated values.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.008
This may just make it a little bit easier

27
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.002
for ChatGPT to digest.

28
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.003
So let's go ahead and copy that, and let's jump into ChatGPT

29
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.006
And we could go ahead and paste that right here.

30
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.003
Now I'm going to jump back up to the top.

31
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to shift enter to add a couple lines,

32
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.007
and this is where I want to add my actual prompt

33
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.004
with what we're looking for.

34
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.008
So first thing I want to do is describe what we've given it,

35
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.000
and then ask for a formula.

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.003
So I've said, here's a sample

37
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.002
of customer data containing 25 records.

38
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:33.007
Could you please write an Excel function

39
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.007
to extract only the username from the email column?

40
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.006
In other words, we want a function that's going to pull all

41
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:44.009
of the characters before the at symbol in the email field.

42
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.008
So I'd expect to get something back using

43
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.007
functions like left and find or search.

44
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:53.001
Let's see how well it does.

45
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.002
Okay, it says to extract only the username

46
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.009
from the email column, you can use the following formula.

47
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.004
Perfect, we get left, search, it's referencing cell D2,

48
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.001
subtracting one to remove the extra character.

49
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.000
So I've written a lot of functions like this,

50
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.006
and at first glance, this looks great.

51
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.005
It says this is assuming the first record starts in row two,

52
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:15.006
you can enter this in F2, and a little description

53
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:19.003
of how it's actually working, which I think is a nice touch.

54
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.001
So let's go ahead and copy this code,

55
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.002
and see if it gets the job done.

56
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.002
All right, so back in Excel, one thing you may have noticed,

57
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.007
it told us to drop this formula in F2,

58
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.003
which isn't quite right.

59
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.002
We're going to drop it in the first blank column,

60
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:33.003
which in this case is G2.

61
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:36.003
And note that we're referencing column D here.

62
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.004
So left of D2, that's not right.

63
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.003
The email field is actually here in column F.

64
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:47.004
So I want to change that D2 to an F2 in both instances.

65
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:51.006
Now let's try that, okay, so we get ChristopherRThames86,

66
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.006
NicoleBPerez68.

67
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.005
So there you go, it did work.

68
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:57.009
It took a couple minor modifications,

69
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.008
but overall, pretty solid.

70
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.006
We can call this something like username.

71
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:04.000
So that's great, right?

72
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.007
But we didn't really need to paste

73
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.005
the data for something like that.

74
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.002
We could have very easily accomplished the same thing

75
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.007
by simply describing the function that we're looking for.

76
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:15.003
Let's jump back to ChatGPT,

77
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:17.004
and see if it can actually analyze

78
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:19.005
the sample that we dropped in there.

79
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.007
So let's ask some questions to see

80
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.003
if it actually can interpret that data.

81
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.008
First up, we can ask something like,

82
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:28.007
who is the oldest customer in the sample?

83
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm going to intentionally leave this a little vague.

84
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.001
I'm not going to say find the smallest value of the date

85
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.001
of birth column because I want to see if it can interpret

86
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.006
just the natural language here.

87
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:44.002
So okay, it says, in order to determine that,

88
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.007
need to find the customer with the earliest date of birth,

89
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:49.004
which is correct, kind of recognize that column.

90
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:52.000
From this list we can see the oldest customer is

91
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.007
Christopher Thames with a date

92
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:56.009
of birth of January 16th, 1950.

93
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.007
Let's spot check in Excel.

94
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.008
Here we go, we're sorted, ascending, got Christopher Thames.

95
00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:05.004
January 16th, 1950, so that looks good.

96
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:08.002
Now let's ask something a little bit tougher.

97
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:09.006
How many customers do we have

98
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:13.009
from Texas based on this sample?

99
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.000
Okay, it's going to say we need to examine the state column.

100
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.008
Uh oh, this isn't the state column,

101
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:23.002
this looks like the city column, that's not right.

102
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:24.009
And it says from this list we can see

103
00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.003
there are three customers from Texas.

104
00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:28.008
I don't know how it's kind of interpreting that.

105
00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:32.007
Let's regenerate and see what we get this time.

106
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:34.005
Okay, this time it's pulling in both city

107
00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:37.007
and state, which looks to be a little bit better.

108
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:40.006
But then it says there are two customers from Texas.

109
00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:47.004
Let's regenerate again and see what we get.

110
00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:48.005
Same kind of list here.

111
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:51.004
Now it's saying there are three customers from Texas,

112
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:53.002
so you should be starting to sense

113
00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.004
a little bit of a red flag here, right?

114
00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:58.008
Which is that clearly ChatGPT has some ability

115
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:01.001
to interpret the data that we've pasted,

116
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.004
but clearly it is far, far from perfect.

117
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.004
So I've played with this with all sorts

118
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.001
of different sample data sets,

119
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:09.007
and I continue to see quite a bit

120
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:12.000
of variability in the responses.

121
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So overall, my take on this use case is that it tends to be

122
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.002
more of a party trick than a valuable tool,

123
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:20.002
especially for analysis.

124
00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:21.005
This is one of those examples

125
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:25.008
where ChatGPT's hallucinations can very easily produce

126
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:27.009
completely incorrect responses.

127
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.004
And in this case, we could easily spot check

128
00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:33.005
since we're working with a very small and simple data set.

129
00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:36.006
But in the real world, that would be pretty unlikely.

130
00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:39.007
So my advice here would be copying and pasting

131
00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:42.009
or providing sample data can be a helpful tool

132
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.007
to help generate formulas

133
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:47.006
and provide ChatGPT with more context.

134
00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:51.004
But asking it to actually analyze the data sample itself is

135
00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:53.009
something that I don't have much confidence in,

136
00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.006
at least at this point.

137
00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:58.002
There are other tools out there like data interpreter

138
00:05:58.002 --> 00:05:59.004
that do this much better,

139
00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:01.008
and I expect this functionality to get stronger

140
00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:04.008
and stronger soon, but at least at this point in time,

141
00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.004
use it with caution.
