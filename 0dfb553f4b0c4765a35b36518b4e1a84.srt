- [Instructor] Hey everybody. In this video,

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.003
we are going to talk about prompt engineering.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.000
You may have heard the term prompt engineering

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.007
in the context of AI tools,

5
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.006
we're going to walk you through what that means,

6
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.002
and then finish with some tips

7
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.001
so that you can write great, effective prompts.

8
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.009
Don't worry, this is all pretty simple,

9
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.008
and we'll walk you through it step by step.

10
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:23.001
So first, a prompt is a question or a set of instructions

11
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.001
that is going to serve as the input for AI tools

12
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.008
like ChatGPT or Google Bard.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.005
And prompt engineering is the practice of writing prompts

14
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.008
that are going to generate the most effective

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.002
and accurate responses.

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.001
So here's an example of a prompt.

17
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.000
This is the question that you're asking of the AI tools

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.004
or the instruction that you're giving.

19
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:44.007
It doesn't have to be a question,

20
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.002
it could be some direction.

21
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.004
You could see the example,

22
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.008
"Can you please explain how the OFFSET function works

23
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.008
in Excel?"

24
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.005
And you'll get back a response like this.

25
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.000
The responses will vary,

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
this is an example from ChatGPT.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.005
Google Bard works the same way,

28
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.006
the other AI tools work the same way.

29
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.000
The main thing we want you to get here

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.003
is the concept of a prompt and a response,

31
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.003
and then our tips and best practices

32
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.003
for writing really good prompts

33
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.002
are to be as clear and specific as possible.

34
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.009
Try to include context and any examples

35
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.002
if that's easy to do.

36
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.009
Establish roles for the specific use cases

37
00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.008
you're working with.

38
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.003
Set the tone or the level of complexity.

39
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.006
And then understand the limitations of the model.

40
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.004
We'll walk you through each of these tips

41
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.008
and we'll do an example of a prompt,

42
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.002
and then we'll improve that prompt

43
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.004
by adding a little bit more context here.

44
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.002
Our pro tip here is to not get bogged down

45
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.003
trying to nail the perfect prompt on the first try.

46
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:40.001
These tools work so quickly

47
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.003
that it's really easy to refine and iterate

48
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.005
if you don't like the quality of your response.

49
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.002
So, try to write a good prompt,

50
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.002
but don't spend too much of your energy

51
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.007
trying to figure out if your prompt is perfect or not,

52
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.005
just get in there and see what you get back as a result.
