- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.008
we're going to give you our next prompt engineering tip

3
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.006
to get better results from AI tools

4
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.004
like ChatGPT and Google Bard,

5
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.004
and that's to establish roles.

6
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.005
What that means is you can assign a role

7
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.001
that the AI tool is going to play

8
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.009
and you can also assign a role that you yourself,

9
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.005
as the receiver of the information, is going to play.

10
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.009
So check out this example.

11
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.008
What's the best way to clean data?

12
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.002
ChatGPT comes back with a response here,

13
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.005
but then we can add so much more context

14
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.009
in terms of the role that we are going to be playing,

15
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.005
a new Data Analyst for a retail business.

16
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.000
And then we want the AI tool to play the role

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.007
of a Data QA Engineer and provide a step-by-step plan

18
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.000
that we can follow.

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.009
So when we establish these roles,

20
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.002
it's more clear to the AI tool

21
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.005
exactly who the audience is,

22
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.008
what you want to be getting in your response,

23
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.004
and it can just really improve the quality

24
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.005
of the result that you get back.
