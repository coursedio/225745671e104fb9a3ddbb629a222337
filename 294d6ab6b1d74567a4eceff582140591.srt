00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Narrator] The rate of adoption

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.007
for modern AI tools is unprecedented.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.009
ChatGPT became the fastest-growing

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.003
online product in history,

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.009
reaching one million users in only five days.

6
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.008
So if it felt like ChatGPT came out of nowhere,

7
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:15.008
it sort of did.

8
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.004
Let's take a look at how other online platforms compare.

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.007
It took Netflix 3.5 years to get to one million users.

10
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.001
It took Twitter two years. It took Facebook 10 months.

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.002
Instagram took 2.5 months, which is pretty good.

12
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.007
But ChatGPT took a mere five days.

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.007
This adoption rate is mind-boggling for any product,

14
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.007
and we're starting to see this cascade

15
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.008
into the AI industry as a whole.

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.002
The rapid advancements in AI technology

17
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.008
as well as the success of ChatGPT

18
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.006
have helped lead an explosion

19
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.004
of new app services and players in the field.

20
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.005
We're seeing implementations of AI

21
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.007
in everywhere from text to video, to images,

22
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:59.006
to code, to speech, 3D modeling, music, and much more.

23
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.004
And we're not necessarily saying that the companies

24
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.001
on this page are going to be what we think are winners

25
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.005
in their given spaces.

26
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:07.007
But it is worth pointing out,

27
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.004
we're seeing more folks try to leverage AI

28
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.005
and apply them to specific problems than we've ever seen.

29
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.008
So we expect a lot of areas

30
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.009
of traditional work to be transformed

31
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.002
or augmented by these tools.

32
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.004
But in this course, we're going to be primarily focused

33
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.001
on ChatGPT and Google Bard, which are two

34
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.002
of the most popular GPT tools on the market.

35
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.005
ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI

36
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.009
which has a close partnership with Microsoft

37
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.007
and Bard was developed in-house at Google.

38
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:39.009
ChatGPT made headlines first releasing in November, 2022,

39
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.001
but Google Bard released shortly thereafter

40
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.003
in early 2023 and is a viable competitor.

41
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.005
Both of these tools have a few unique strengths

42
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.001
but are very similar in terms

43
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.003
of benefits and limitations for data professionals.

44
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:54.003
Speaking of limitations, let's go ahead

45
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.002
and take a look at some common pitfalls

46
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.005
that we can experience when using these tools.
