00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Next up, I've got a really fun demo for you.

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.000
We're going to talk

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.009
about how you can use ChatGPT

4
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.006
to Automate Tasks in Excel

5
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.000
By Generating VBA Scripts and Macros.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.008
So for this demo, what I've got here is a list

7
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.001
of some of the top earning movies of all time.

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.002
It's stored in a macro-enabled Excel workbook,

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.004
but you can see that it's a little bit messy, right.

10
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.005
My row heights are all over the place.

11
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.009
My column widths aren't fit properly,

12
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.003
and basically my goal is to clean and polish this up.

13
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.005
Maybe add some alternating row highlights with the goal

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.006
of exporting this as a static PDF that I can share.

15
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.001
Now, that's certainly possible to do manually

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.007
or just take a few steps,

17
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.007
but if this is something that I'm going to do again and again,

18
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:46.003
it makes it a great candidate for VBA automation.

19
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.006
So let's pop into ChatGPT.

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.002
Let's describe exactly what we're looking for

21
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:55.002
and see if it can produce AVBA script that we can use.

22
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.007
Alright, so let's go ahead and plug

23
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.009
in a description of what we're looking for.

24
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.002
Be very descriptive and clear here, right,

25
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.005
I have an Excel worksheet named top movies

26
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.001
containing a table with the following fields, title,

27
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.000
genre country rating, IMDB score and gross revenue.

28
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.008
Can you please generate AVBA script to autofit

29
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.002
all rows and columns,

30
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.003
bold the first row, highlight every other row,

31
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:23.001
and save it to my desktop using this file path as a PDF?

32
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.005
And because I'm not really strong with VBA,

33
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:26.004
I've also asked it

34
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.005
to provide clear step-by-step instructions.

35
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.008
So let's see how this goes.

36
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.002
All right, so far so good.

37
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:35.008
It says I can help you with that.

38
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:39.001
Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a VBA script,

39
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.005
that will do all of those steps that we described.

40
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.000
It's writing the script now.

41
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.008
You can see some comments in here.

42
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.005
Really nice that it's commenting the code,

43
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.009
making it nice and clear,

44
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.005
and then it's giving us kind of

45
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.000
all of those steps that we'll need to follow

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.005
and this is looking good so far.

47
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.007
So basically we're creating a sub-routine export as PDF.

48
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:04.008
We're setting variable names for the worksheet

49
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.000
and the string.

50
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.002
This is where we're autofitting the rows and columns.

51
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.000
This is where we're formatting the table with those kind

52
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.001
of highlights every other row.

53
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.007
This is where we're saving it as a PDF.

54
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.008
You can see that it's used the file path,

55
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:20.004
it's named at top movies PDF, which makes sense.

56
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.001
And then this is really nice too at the end,

57
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.007
it's popping up a message box that's going to say,

58
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.006
worksheet saved as PDF on the desktop,

59
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.006
which is a nice touch as well.

60
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.001
So this is looking great.

61
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.004
Let's go ahead and copy this code

62
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:36.004
and let's jump back into our Excel workbook

63
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.003
and we can either use F11

64
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:40.005
or head to our developer tab

65
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.004
to open up the VBA dialogue box

66
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:46.004
or window right here and right here in sheet two top movies.

67
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:47.008
Let's go ahead and view the code

68
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:52.005
and paste that code that ChatGPT produced right here.

69
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.001
So let's go ahead and give this a shot.

70
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.007
I don't think I need to necessarily change anything here

71
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.001
at least right off the bat.

72
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.004
Let's go ahead and save that, close the editor.

73
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:02.008
And now is a nice little touch

74
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:06.002
what I'm going to do is insert a little box here

75
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.000
kind of like a button that we can use.

76
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.005
Add some text, export as PDF

77
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.007
and we'll format that a little bit like so

78
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.001
and then I can right click.

79
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.000
We're going to assign a macro

80
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.005
and that's the sub-routine or the macro

81
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:27.000
that ChatGPT just produced, export as PDF, press OK.

82
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.005
And now drum roll please,

83
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:29.007
if I click this button

84
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:34.007
what we should see, again, is the columns and rows autofit.

85
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:37.005
We should see every other row get highlighted.

86
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:41.001
We should see that top header row get formatted in bold.

87
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:44.005
And most importantly, it should export that data set

88
00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:47.007
as a static PDF on my desktop.

89
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:51.006
So cross your fingers, let's give it a click.

90
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.004
There we go.

91
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:53.002
We get that message box.

92
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:56.001
It says worksheet saved as PDF on the desktop.

93
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.006
We can see right here the columns did autofit.

94
00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:01.005
The rows autofit, header row is bold.

95
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:04.007
We've got that alternating highlighting, so far so good.

96
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, let's go ahead and check our desktop and look at this,

97
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.002
we've got a PDF called Top movies, and when we double click

98
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.005
there is our formatted data set

99
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.002
that ChatGPT helped us produce.

100
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.003
So overall, I was really, really impressed by this example,

101
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:22.001
especially as someone who doesn't have a ton

102
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.005
of experience writing VBA code.

103
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:26.005
This probably would've taken me closer to 20

104
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:28.007
or 30 minutes of trial and error

105
00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:32.002
or searching online tutorials to produce this same code.

106
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:35.004
But ChatGPT gave it to us in about 30 seconds,

107
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:38.001
which is pretty unbelievable when you think about it.

108
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:40.002
I love that it added code comments.

109
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:42.004
I love that it included the file path.

110
00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:43.003
It was nice

111
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.002
that it added those clear step-by-step instructions.

112
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:49.007
Just a great shortcut, especially for non-coders

113
00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:52.005
who come across the need to use VBA for automation.
