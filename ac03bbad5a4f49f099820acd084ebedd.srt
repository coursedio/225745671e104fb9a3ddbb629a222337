00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Alright, so for this next demo,

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.004
what I want to do is see if we can use ChatGPT

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.008
to generate clear step-by-step instructions or guidelines

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.005
for conducting some sort of analysis in Excel.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.004
I'm going to walk through two examples here,

6
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.009
starting relatively simple with a basic PivotTable,

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.004
and then we're going to try something a bit more advanced

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.000
by creating a relational data model using Power Pivot.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.008
And what I want to see is if ChatGPT

10
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.008
can guide us through this process

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.008
as if we were a beginner user

12
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.003
without much familiarity with these tools.

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.003
So for the first demo, what we've got here

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.007
is a basic sample of product orders.

15
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.005
Got order IDs in column A, product names in B,

16
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.001
quantity, price, revenue,

17
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.008
and a categorical field called Order Size,

18
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.004
which is based on the quantity purchased.

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.006
Now, suppose we wanted to calculate the average revenue

20
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.002
for each order size specifically.

21
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.005
This is something that's very easy to do with a PivotTable.

22
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.008
Let's see if ChatGPT can walk us through the process.

23
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.006
So what I'm actually going to do is copy

24
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.001
a little sample of the data here,

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.008
and now let's jump into ChatGPT.

26
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.003
Let's go ahead and paste that sample here,

27
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.006
and I'm going to shift down,

28
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.008
and add the rest of my prompt like so.

29
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.007
All right, so we're saying I have an Excel table

30
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.005
containing the following fields

31
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:21.004
from the table we just looked at.

32
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.007
I need to create a PivotTable

33
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.009
showing the average revenue for each order size

34
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.006
formatted as currency, USD.

35
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.004
And then we're saying,

36
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.001
please provide clear step-by-step instructions

37
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.006
for creating the PivotTable using Excel for Office 365,

38
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.002
and here's a sample of the first,

39
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.000
in this case, I think it was 15 rows of data.

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.007
Let's see how ChatGPT does with this one.

41
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.001
All right, looking good so far.

42
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.006
So to create a PivotTable

43
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.003
showing the average revenue for each order size

44
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.007
in Excel for Office 365,

45
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:00.000
follow these step-by-step instructions.

46
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.008
Now, let's see if we can pull these instructions up

47
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.007
side by side with our Excel file,

48
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.006
and see if we can walk through them step by step.

49
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.007
All right, so here we go,

50
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.003
we've got our instructions on the right from ChatGPT,

51
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:12.004
we've got our Excel sheet on the left.

52
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.006
So open our Excel file, done.

53
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.004
Select the range of cells that includes the data,

54
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.004
including headers.

55
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.007
Control A, there we go.

56
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.004
Go to the Insert tab, boom,

57
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.006
click on the PivotTable button, which is right here.

58
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.001
That opens the create PivotTable dialog box.

59
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.001
Ensure the range is correct, that looks good,

60
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.009
A1 through F101.

61
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.005
Let's place this on the existing worksheet,

62
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.006
kind of right over here in H2.

63
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.008
Step seven, click OK to create the PivotTable, there we go.

64
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.004
Now the PivotTable field list

65
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.007
will appear on the right side, it did.

66
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:49.002
From the field list, locate order size, drag it into rows.

67
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.003
Easy enough.

68
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.006
Locate Revenue, drag it into Values.

69
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.008
By default, it should already be set to Sum of Revenue.

70
00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.006
It is, but now we need to change the summary to average.

71
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.000
So we're going to click that dropdown arrow,

72
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.001
select Value Field Settings, and select Average.

73
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.009
From here, press OK.

74
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.000
And let's see how this is starting to look.

75
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.009
I'm going to scroll over here.

76
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.006
There we go, we've got our order sizes listed out.

77
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:21.000
We've got our average revenues by order size and our values.

78
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.002
We've gone through the first 13 steps without any issue.

79
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.002
So now I think the last step

80
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:27.006
was just to format those as currency.

81
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:32.001
So we're going to right click any value in the values area,

82
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.002
choose Value Field Settings, then Number Format,

83
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.004
or we could skip a click

84
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:37.005
and just go straight to Number Format,

85
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.003
select Currency from the category list,

86
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.002
choose USD, which is the dollar sign,

87
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:45.009
select the number of decimal places, which is two,

88
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.006
and then click OK.

89
00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:49.007
So that's step 19,

90
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.005
click OK to apply the currency formatting to the PivotTable.

91
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:55.006
We've got average revenue of $162 for large orders,

92
00:03:55.006 --> 00:04:00.005
41 for medium, and 8.49 for small, which sounds about right.

93
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.006
And there we go.

94
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.002
It says you should now have a PivotTable

95
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:06.004
showing the average revenue for each order size

96
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:07.006
formatted as currency.

97
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.000
I like the caveat here, but in this case,

98
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.005
that actually worked perfectly without a hitch.

99
00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:15.007
That's exactly how I would approach it as an expert.

100
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.009
Great, clear step-by-step instructions.

101
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.008
Now let's push it a little bit further

102
00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:24.005
and see if ChatGPT can effectively give us some guidelines

103
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:26.005
for something a bit more complicated,

104
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:29.008
like creating a relational data model.

105
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:31.006
So for this example, I have a new workbook,

106
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.008
it's called Data Model.

107
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:35.006
And in that workbook, I have four different tabs.

108
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:38.000
Each tab contains a table.

109
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.009
This table contains transactions, with a transaction date,

110
00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.007
product ID, customer ID, and quantity.

111
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:48.004
Then I have a calendar table, I have a product table,

112
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:51.006
and I have a customer table as well.

113
00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:53.009
And each of those tables has a primary key,

114
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.006
in this case, customer ID.

115
00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.001
For products, we have product ID

116
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.000
to relate these tables back to our transactions

117
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.001
and analyze all this information together using Power Pivot.

118
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:06.006
So for this example, what I'm actually going to do

119
00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:10.008
is show you how I would approach this first as an expert,

120
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:14.000
and then I'm going to provide a prompt to ChatGPT,

121
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.005
and then compare my approach

122
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:19.003
to how ChatGPT recommends tackling this type of task.

123
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.004
So here's how I would approach it.

124
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.009
I would go through each of these four tables,

125
00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.002
I would open up the Power Pivot tab,

126
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:30.006
and I would add each table to the data model like so.

127
00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:31.008
So I'm starting with transactions.

128
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:35.003
I'm going to go back to calendar, Add to Data Model,

129
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:37.005
see, it adds a second tab there,

130
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:41.006
go to products, Add to Data Model,

131
00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:45.009
and then you guessed it, same story for customers,

132
00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.009
Add to Data Model.

133
00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.006
So now I've effectively loaded all four of those tables

134
00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:53.007
into Excel's data model.

135
00:05:53.007 --> 00:05:54.008
Didn't have to go through Power Query,

136
00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.009
didn't have to do any table imports or anything fancy.

137
00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.009
Simply one click from that Power Pivot menu,

138
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.008
and all my data's in here.

139
00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:05.009
Now, really all I need to do is jump into Diagram View

140
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.007
where I can see all four of those tables,

141
00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:11.000
and I can create those relationships

142
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.004
by mapping the primary keys in my lookup tables

143
00:06:14.004 --> 00:06:17.009
to my foreign keys in my data or fact table.

144
00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.009
And that's it, now I've got my properly related data model

145
00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.002
here in Power Pivot.

146
00:06:23.002 --> 00:06:25.004
I could add a PivotTable

147
00:06:25.004 --> 00:06:27.000
to start analyzing or exploring that data,

148
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.001
but really, it was as simple as that.

149
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:32.004
So now that we've seen my approach, let's take a look at

150
00:06:32.004 --> 00:06:36.003
how ChatGPT recommends approaching this.

151
00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:38.003
So why don't we do a new prompt here.

152
00:06:38.003 --> 00:06:41.001
I'm going to try to be as clear and descriptive

153
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.000
as I possibly can with this prompt.

154
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So notice I've already kind of precopied samples

155
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.002
from each of the four tables

156
00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:50.008
in that workbook we walked through.

157
00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:52.008
But I'm basically telling ChatGPT,

158
00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:55.006
I've got this Excel workbook, it's called Data Model.

159
00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:57.001
It contains the following tables,

160
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:58.009
transactions, calendar, products, and customers.

161
00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.000
I've included sample data from each table below.

162
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.002
This is a sample from transactions, from calendar,

163
00:07:05.002 --> 00:07:07.009
from products, and from customers.

164
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.004
The reason I'm doing this is to make sure that ChatGPT

165
00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:14.000
can see the primary and foreign keys,

166
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.002
and recommend meaningful table relationships here.

167
00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:20.004
And then I'm saying please provide step-by-step instructions

168
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:23.001
to add these tables to Excel's data model

169
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.007
and join them together using Power Pivot.

170
00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:29.006
I'm using Excel for Office 365.

171
00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:32.001
So I'm being about as explicit as I possibly can.

172
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.003
Let's see how ChatGPT does.

173
00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:39.001
Alright, so it says to add these tables

174
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.003
to Excel's data model

175
00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.001
and join them together using Power Pivot,

176
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:45.000
follow these step-by-step instructions.

177
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.009
So open the Data Model workbook, great.

178
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:50.003
Make sure the Power Pivot add-in is enabled.

179
00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.009
That's really only relevant for older versions of Excel,

180
00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.009
but that's okay.

181
00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:58.002
Click Power Pivot, click Add to Data Model,

182
00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:02.004
choose From Other Sources, select Table, click Next,

183
00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:05.007
go through the Table Import Wizard, choose the Excel file,

184
00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:08.004
import the data, load it to the data model.

185
00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:11.005
Lot of extra steps there that we didn't have to do

186
00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:14.006
because our tables were already stored in worksheets.

187
00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:17.005
And then from there, it's saying select Diagram View,

188
00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:18.007
which we did.

189
00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:20.001
And this actually looks pretty good.

190
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.004
So it's saying drag and drop customer ID from transactions

191
00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:25.003
to customer ID in customers.

192
00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:27.001
That creates a relationship between those tables.

193
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:29.006
That looks good, that's exactly what we did.

194
00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:30.006
Same story with product ID,

195
00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:33.007
same story with date to the calendar.

196
00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:35.001
And then you can close the Power Pivot window.

197
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:37.001
So overall, not bad.

198
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:40.000
Definitely kind of walked you through some extra steps there

199
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.001
in the beginning,

200
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.004
but I think this ultimately would've gotten you

201
00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:45.008
to the right end result.

202
00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:47.004
Let's actually regenerate this again,

203
00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:50.000
'cause I've seen a few different types of outputs

204
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.002
that it's provided.

205
00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:55.004
So same story here.

206
00:08:55.004 --> 00:08:57.008
We're enabling Power Pivot first,

207
00:08:57.008 --> 00:09:02.007
importing the data using Power Query, From Table and Range.

208
00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:06.006
Then we're defining relationships.

209
00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:08.008
This one goes a little bit further

210
00:09:08.008 --> 00:09:11.007
into creating a PivotTable to actually analyze the data.

211
00:09:11.007 --> 00:09:14.003
So again, not bad, not great.

212
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:18.000
Let's do one more, and see what we get this time.

213
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.002
So again, it's kind of taking us

214
00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:22.002
through the Power Query approach,

215
00:09:22.002 --> 00:09:23.006
which I think is kind of an extra step.

216
00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:27.007
Get & Transform, From Other Sources, From Workbook,

217
00:09:27.007 --> 00:09:30.000
load it, add it to the data model.

218
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.006
So overall, decent response,

219
00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:34.007
not the most efficient way to approach it.

220
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:37.001
And to be honest, there were a few times

221
00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:40.001
where I ran this query and got totally wacky advice

222
00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:42.007
to start writing custom M queries,

223
00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:44.004
just things that were totally unnecessary here.

224
00:09:44.004 --> 00:09:46.009
So overall, I think this is another use case

225
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.008
that I definitely approach with caution.

226
00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:51.009
It was definitely helpful for getting started

227
00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:54.005
with relatively simple tasks,

228
00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.005
like PivotTables, or formulas for instance.

229
00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:58.004
But there were a number of times

230
00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:00.001
where it sent me down the wrong path,

231
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.005
or at least an inefficient path

232
00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:03.003
when I tried to get guidance on things

233
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.001
that were a bit more sophisticated,

234
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:07.006
even after I spent quite a long time

235
00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:10.002
testing and refining different prompts.

236
00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:12.006
So this is a case where if you don't know better,

237
00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:15.003
you could potentially waste a lot of time

238
00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:18.002
going down unproductive rabbit holes,

239
00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.005
or following inefficient roundabout instructions

240
00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:23.003
to accomplish something that could have been done

241
00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:24.009
in a much simpler way.

242
00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.002
So my advice here, consider using ChatGPT

243
00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.006
as a thought starter for this type of thing,

244
00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:32.000
but you're likely to get better guidance

245
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
from online tutorials,

246
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.003
or better yet, by consulting actual experts.
