00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.009
- [Instructor] Okay, so now

2
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.000
that we've covered some important background information

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.008
on these tools,

4
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.000
it's time to take a look at how to access them.

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.006
It's quite straightforward.

6
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:11.007
You can access ChatGPT for free at chat.openai.com.

7
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.006
Once you visit that site for the first time,

8
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.006
you'll see a Create your account window pop up,

9
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.003
and OpenAI currently allows anyone to sign up

10
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.006
and use ChatGPT for free.

11
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:22.008
It's also worth being aware

12
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.009
that there's a paid premium version as well

13
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.006
that gets you access to a more advanced model

14
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.004
and fewer usage constraints.

15
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.007
But we'll be using the free version in this course.

16
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.003
You can either create an account by using an email address

17
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:38.000
or by connecting to an existing Microsoft or Google account.

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.006
And if you're curious about reading more

19
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.002
from the OpenAI team on ChatGPT,

20
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:47.006
you can go to their blog at openai.com/blog/chatgpt.

21
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.002
It's very straightforward to get started.

22
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.000
Google Bard is quite similar.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.005
You can access Google Bard for free at bard.google.com.

24
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.001
Google does require that you have a Google account,

25
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.009
so if you already have a Gmail account,

26
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.004
you can use that to sign up.

27
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:02.005
And if you don't have one,

28
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.008
you'll be prompted to create one on the page.

29
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.007
Google made Bard available for free

30
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.002
in May 2023 in most countries,

31
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.007
and if you want to read more about Bard,

32
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.008
you can go to bard.google.com/faq.

33
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:15.006
So if you want to get started with these tools

34
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:17.001
and work alongside us,

35
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.002
go ahead and take a few minutes to get set up,

36
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.002
and you'll see John in the next section.
