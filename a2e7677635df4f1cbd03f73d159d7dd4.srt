00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] All right, welcome to the ChatGPT for Excel

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.003
section of the course.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.009
In this section, we'll be exploring some of the most common

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.001
and powerful use cases for data professionals

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.001
to use ChatGPT with Microsoft Excel,

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.000
including things like generating formulas and functions,

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.003
troubleshooting and diagnosing errors,

8
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.009
explaining complex topics and much, much more.

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.007
So here's a quick review of some of the topics and demos

10
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.001
that we'll dig into.

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.008
We're going to use tools like ChatGPT and Bard

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.002
to help explain complex formulas

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.006
or topics to us as if it's our own personal tutor.

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.002
We'll also use these tools to generate brand new

15
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:41.003
worksheet formulas as well as DAX measures and M Code.

16
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.003
We'll see how ChatGPT can help us automate tasks

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.008
with VBA macros and custom scripts.

18
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.002
And from there we'll practice loading sample data

19
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.008
into ChatGPT using it to troubleshoot and diagnose

20
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.006
formula errors, practice generating step-by-step tutorials

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.006
or roadmaps for things like data prep

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.004
and exploratory analysis.

23
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.009
And finally, we'll use these tools to actually

24
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:06.004
generate industry specific sample data sets.

25
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.001
So our goals for this section, we're going to learn how to use

26
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.001
ChatGPT and prompt engineering to help explain

27
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.009
complex Excel formulas or concepts.

28
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.006
We'll also generate new formulas based on either

29
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:21.002
text descriptions or sample data that we provide.

30
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.007
We'll generate DAX, M, and VBA code

31
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.000
for things like data modeling, analysis, and automation.

32
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.008
We'll troubleshoot broken formulas or code.

33
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.000
And again, we'll use ChatGPT to actually provide us

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.008
with step-by-step plans for data prep,

35
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:39.002
quality assurance, exploratory analysis, and more.

36
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.008
We've got a lot of really fun topics to dig into.

37
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:42.008
So let's get started.
