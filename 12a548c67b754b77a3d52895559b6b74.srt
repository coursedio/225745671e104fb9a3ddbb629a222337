00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Lecturer] In this video, we're going to walk you through

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.009
another tip for prompt engineering to get better results

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.001
from AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.005
This time we're going to be talking about setting the tone

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.008
which can have a major impact on what you see as a response.

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.005
You could see an example here where we just say

7
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.001
explain regression analysis, but what does that mean?

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.009
Are we explaining regression analysis

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.002
to somebody that's really technical?

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.004
Are we explaining it to a four year old?

11
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.001
The more context you can give the AI tools in terms

12
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.002
of how you want it to talk, the level things like that,

13
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.006
the better it's going to do at giving you an output

14
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.005
that matches what you really want.

15
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.009
So here in the improved prompt you can see,

16
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.006
we say explain regression analysis in two sentences

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.007
to a C-level executive at a marketing agency.

18
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.008
So here, it's not going to go as technical.

19
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.008
It's giving you kind of a quicker soundbite

20
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.003
about what regression analysis is,

21
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.003
and it's going to be more appropriate for that audience.

22
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.006
Our pro tip here is to include something

23
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.006
in the prompt that says, explain it to me

24
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.000
as if you are explaining it to X, Y, Z.

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.001
And that could be a child, it could be somebody

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.006
who's non-technical, somebody who isn't a data expert.

27
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.004
And in this way, you can control the tone

28
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.008
and the complexity of the response that you're getting.

29
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:15.002
So try to keep this in mind.

30
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.002
Being prescriptive about the tone can really have an impact

31
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.006
on your results and can help you get a response

32
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.009
that's going to be the most appropriate for your audience

33
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.001
or for the problem that you're trying to solve.
